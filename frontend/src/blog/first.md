I will try to update here with my progress on various projects and ideas. Exam week coming up so expect nothing until after.

Afterwards I have a couple of projects I want to work on, including:
- My own programming language themed after frogs 
- Stock trading website to practice trading with fake money
- Something with websockets not sure yet

Thanks for reading!
