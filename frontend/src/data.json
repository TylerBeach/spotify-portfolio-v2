We used Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed us to create a responsive and modern design. The backend is powered by AWS RDS, which provides a scalable and reliable database solution. NextAuth was used for authentication, allowing users to sign up and log in securely. Python was used for the web scraping and data processing, which allowed for the collection of data from Harvard Health, the FDA and the World Health Organization. Figma was used for the prototyping of the application, allowing us to create a user-friendly interface and design. The project was hosted on Vercel, which provides a fast and reliable hosting solution for Next.js applications."

Additionally, Event Horizon integrates with Google Maps, providing users with a visual representation of event locations. This integration allows users to view the event's location directly within the app, receive directions, and even check in upon arrival.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was employed to separate concerns within the app, ensuring that the data (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (Controller) are handled independently. This separation not only makes the app easier to manage and extend but also enhances its testability. The Adapter pattern was utilized to allow the app to interface seamlessly with various APIs, such as Firebase and Google Maps, by converting their data formats into a format the application can easily handle. Furthermore, the Singleton pattern was implemented for managing instances of Firebase, ensuring a single point of access to the database, which enhances performance and reduces the risk of data inconsistencies. These patterns were integral to the development of Event Horizon, allowing the team to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, real-world project.
