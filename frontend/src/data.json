It emphasizes functional programming with controlled side effects. The language distinguishes pure functions (no side effects, usable in expressions) from procedures (allow side effects and I/O, called with <code>call</code>). By default, variables are immutable (<code>const</code>); mutability requires <code>var</code>. Gazprea supports <code>integers</code>, <code>chars</code>, <code>floats</code>, <code>booleans</code>, <code>arrays</code>, <code>matrices</code>, <code>vectors</code>, <code>strings</code>, <code>tuples</code>, and <code>structs</code>, with inferred-size declarations using <code>[*]</code>. Generator expressions like <code>[i in 1..10 | i * i]</code> enable declarative array construction, and the range operator <code>1..10</code> creates integer sequences. The type system includes type inference, type aliases, and automatic promotion. Built-in functions include <code>length()</code>, <code>shape()</code>, <code>reverse()</code>, and <code>format()</code>. Arrays are 1-indexed, and stream I/O uses <code>-></code> and <code><-</code> operators. These features make Gazprea suitable for mathematical and scientific computing while maintaining clear separation between pure computations and side effects."

Our group really focused on having clean and maintainable code which was a great learning experience for me. Regular standups and pull request reviews helped keep the project on track and ensured that we were all on the same page. Our team also prioratized testing highly. In total our Compiler was about 31,000 lines of code. By the end of the term had about 32,000 lines of tests to ensure that our compiler met the specifications and worked as intended. Without these large amounts of tests I don't think we would have been able to complete the project successfully."
